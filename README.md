## Part A: Snowflake/Data Setup

1. Create your own tables in the playground: What table do we need for the model? what is x (what features?) and what is y (success score vs POSITION column vs ranking?) Choose measure of success (do we need it? isnt the 'winning' the true measure?)
2. Drop columns join columns, cleanse and shape the data to best suit your needs 
*OPTIONAL*: use Beautiful Soup to web scrape and enrich your data, using this Task brief, F1 main website and judging criteria to guide your selection 

## Part B: Winning Factor Correlation Model 

1. Select a method to handle missing values, DNF (did not finish), and cleanse data.
2. Select and develop a **Machine Learning model** to identify the key factors that correlate with **Mercedes’** wins in races. The models given, are examples, feel free and be creative with your model selection.
3. You can use Python natively in Snowflake or you can export your data to a preferred IDE. 
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
5. Conduct factor analysis, to identify the extent to which pole gap, lap time and location, contribute to success, to identify which of these factors, most influence the race outcome.  (e.g., using Random Forest or Linear Regression).
